        <h1>THE NISSAN GTR R34</h1>
    
        <p>The Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 is a legendary JDM icon, produced from 1999 to 2002. It's the poster child of late '90s/early 2000s performance cars, combining raw power, advanced tech (for its time), and aggressive styling. Famously nicknamed “Godzilla”, the R34 was the final iteration of the RB26-powered Skylines before Nissan transitioned to the modern GT-R line (R35).

It blew up in car culture thanks to its appearance in Fast & Furious, Gran Turismo, and real-world motorsports. It was built for domination—street, track, or touge.</p>
